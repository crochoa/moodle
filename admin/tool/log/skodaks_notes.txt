Grrrr:

1/ 'level' is reserved DB word - we must change event base property name
2/ admin tool subplugins are much nicer
3/ public function can_access($user = null) does not know context, we need it otherwise teachers are f...!
4/ writer::store() should get the manager if we want to share the filtering
5/ we need some dispose() magic
6/ 'storage' word is too long, 'store' should be better - we need the subsystem name as short as possible


TODO:
* standard db table indexes - timecreated, component, etc.?
